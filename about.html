  <hr>

  <p>Greetings user, I am Jacob Post. I am 18 years old and am currently in my senior year of high school at Licking Heights High School. I currently live at home with my mom, dad, my younger sister named Ally, and my dog who is named Chico. Usually,
    I can be found in my room sitting at my computer desk using my computer, but sometimes I might be playing a game that is on one of my game consoles instead. I am a gamer and a video creator, and if I'm not playing a game or using social media,
    then I'm making a video. Despite all of this, I hold a strong enjoyment for school and undeerstand the importance of learning for future success.</p>

  <h2>Likes</h2>
  <p>As a gamer, most of my likes revolve around video games and various different game series. Out of all of the games I've played so far, my favorite is currently a tie between Fire Emblem Three Houses and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. My favorite
    video game series is the Pokemon series, which I got into with the fourth generation games, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. Some of my other likes include: Recording videos, listening to music, watching YouTube videos and the occasional anime episode,
    drawing, singing, and playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>While one of my main hobbies is playing video games, I enjoy other hobbies than just those that are related to gaming. Other than playing video games, one of my other big hobbies is recording videos. I record videos as a way to combine my hobby
    of playing videos games with the ability to entertain people who watch the videos of my gameplay. These recorded videos would then be uploaded to my YouTube channel for people to watch, and I occasionally also do a livestream on my Twitch
    channel. Some other hobbies of mine other than video games and video recording are: playing golf, playing chess, reading, and playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).</p>
