  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <hr>

  <p>Greetings user, I am Jacob Post. I am 18 years old and am currently in my senior year of high school at Licking Heights High School. I currently live at home with my mom, dad, my younger sister named Ally, and my dog who is named Chico.
    <!-- insert picture of Chico --> Usually, I can be found in my room sitting at my computer desk using my computer, but sometimes I might be playing a game that is on one of my game consoles instead. I am a gamer and a video creator, and if I'm
    not playing a game or using social media, then I'm making a video. Despite all of this, I hold a strong enjoyment for school and undeerstand the importance of learning for future success.</p>
